"K8s Means Kubernetes"  
K8S

I have interview tomorrow

I 
an open source container orchestration platform that automates many of the manual processes involved in deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applicationsÂ 
Kubernetes manages various clusters at the same time

Main Components of kubernetes
Master Node
the node that controls and manages the set of worker nodes 
nodes are responsible for the cluster management and the API used to configure and manage the resources within the collection.
Worker Node
A node is the smallest fundamental unit of computing hardware. It represents a single machine in a cluster, which could be a physical machine in a data center or a virtual machine from a cloud provider. Each machine can substitute any other machine in a Kubernetes cluster. The master in Kubernetes controls the nodes that have containers.
MINIKUBE
With the help of Minikube, users can Kubernetes locally. This process lets the user run a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your personal computer.With this, users can try out Kubernetes also for daily development work
ETCD
Kubernetes uses etcd as a distributed key-value store for all of its data, including metadata and configuration data, and allows nodes in Kubernetes clusters to read and write data.

KUBELET
The kubelet is a service agent that controls and maintains a set of pods by watching for pod specs through the Kubernetes API server. It preserves the pod lifecycle by ensuring that a given set of containers are all running as they should. The kubelet runs on each node and enables the communication between the master and slave node
Kubectl
Kubectl is a CLI (command-line interface) that is used to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. As such, it controls the Kubernetes cluster manager through different create and manage commands on the Kubernetes component
